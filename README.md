This is the website for "Transcriptomics of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Cells Identifies New Molecular Endotypes of Sarcoidosis".

# Background
Sarcoidosis is a multisystem chronic granulomatous disease with lung involvement in more than 90% cases. High diversity in clinical progression and disease outcome makes it challenging to define well characterized phenotypes. 

We conducted both supervised and unsupervised analysis on the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) transcriptomic profiles from a cohort of sarcoidosis patients (n=219) grouped in 8 clinical phenotypes:  stage I, stage II-III treated, stage II-III untreated, stage IV treated, stage IV untreated, acute sarcoidosis, remitting and multiorgan. RNA was isolated from BAL cells and sequenced by Ion Torrent Proton. Non-parametric correlation test and the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were used to identify gene modules associated with each clinical trait and severity of disease. Validation was performed using a microarray expression dataset of an independent Sarcoidosis cohort (Freiburg, Germany (n=50)).

Supervised analysis using 209 BAL samples identified relatively low number of genes with limited significance associated with clinical phenotypes (stage I, II-III and IV, acute, remitting and multiorgan), severity of disease and treatment (FC<-2 or >2; p<0.05). However, when demographics, Scadding, PFTs, CT imaging features and cell differentials were analyzed as continuous variables, numerous pathways implicated in cell cycle, immune response, and lipid metabolism were identified. The unsupervised analysis of entire cohort revealed 5 new distinguished gene modules significantly associated with multiple clinical traits and BAL cell differentials. Cluster analysis of these gene modules identified novel groups of subjects to have: 1) hilar lymphadenopathy and acute lymphocytic inflammation, 2) extraocular organ involvement and PI3K activation, 3) chronic and remitting disease and 4) multiorgan disease with increased immune response. These 4 novel endotypes were successfully validated for association of gene expression with cell differentials and PFTs using Freiburg cohort (chi-square p value<0.05).  
  
Our approach allowed identification of novel subject’s groupings suggestive of distinct sarcoidosis molecular and clinical endotypes.
